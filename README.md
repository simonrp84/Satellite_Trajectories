A tool to overlay trajectory data (such as aircraft flight paths) on top of images from geostationary satellites.

This tool takes (currently) an aircraft flight path, interpolates it to a given temporal resolution and produces an output map for each timestep that includes the aircraft position, prior track (colour coded by altitude) and start/end points overlaid on an appropriate geostationary satellite image.

NOTE: This is work-in-progress, there will be many updates and changes!
